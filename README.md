# BIRDIE
This repository contains code and documentation related to the South Africa Biodiversity Data Pipeline for Wetlands and Waterbirds (BIRDIE) project: https://jrsbiodiversity.org/grants/sanbi-2020/

## Basic structure
The folders *R*, *data* and *man* contain functions, data and documentation for the BIRDIE package respectively. See the file *main_dev.R*, to get and idea of how to include new functions and modify existing ones. The folder *data_prep* stores scripts that are used to create data that is contained in the package, so that we can keep track of how data were produced.

The folder *analysis* contains data, scripts and outputs from analyses related to the BIRDIE project. This folder is not part of the package, so nothing in there is meant to be installed.
