\begin{abstract}

1000 words max

We are collecting a lot of data

We need to process and analyze these data to make it useful for decision making

Fast and effective decision making is necessary to stop biodiversity loss and preserve ecosystem services

Wetlands deliver critical ecosystem services

Birds are convenient indicators of the state of wetlands

With the South African Biodiversity Data Pipeline for Wetlands and Waterbirds, we use two citizen science
bird monitoring dataset to assess the state of waterbirds populations and its relationship with 
wetland conditions.

Acknowledging that decision making must occur at multiple scales, from site management to international
coordination, we have developed a granular framework in which population indicators are estimated
at small scales, and then these are aggregated to understand changes at broader scales.
