With increasing pressure on Earth's ecosystems, we have seen substantial efforts
in the collection of ecological and environmental data, over the last decade. More
recently, data management workflows and repositories have improved, making these
data more accessible. However, raw data needs to be analyzed and interrogated in
order to make management decisions; a process that can be complex and time
consuming. The South African Biodiversity Data Pipeline for Wetlands and
Waterbirds (BIRDIE) aims at helping fast and efficient decision making, bridging
the gap between raw ecological datasets and final decision makers. BIRDIE will be
an online portal that will not only serve ecological data, but also implement
analytical routines to process these data and produce policy-relevant indicators. 
The project focuses on waterbirds and their use as indicators of wetland condition. 
We use two citizen-science bird monitoring datasets to assess the state
of waterbirds populations in South Africa, and a suite of environmental 
layers to link waterbird populations with the state of the hosting wetlands. 
Acknowledging that decision making must occur at multiple scales, from site
management to international coordination, we have developed a granular framework
in which population indicators are estimated at small scales, and then these are
aggregated to compute the similar indicators at broader scales. BIRDIE will provide free 
access to these indicators on an online dashboard that will go live next year, and
that will be updated regularly, as new data arrive. Although the project is 
currently focused on South Africa, the same waterbird datasets are available for
other African countries, and therefore we envision expanding BIRDIE's coverage
in the future. We are also working towards integration with other biodiversity 
data portals to offer more holistic coverage of wetland biodiversity.
