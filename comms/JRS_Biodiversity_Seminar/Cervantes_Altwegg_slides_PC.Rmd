## Data pipeline

One slide showing the data pipeline diagram to explain how this part fits into the pipeline

## The types of decisions that need to be supported

Perhaps a brief slide on what kind of decisions / reporting this information is meant to feed into. Unless Nancy / Francis are planning to cover this

## Objectives

\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate metrics such as:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[-] distribution,
    \item[-] abundance,
    \item[-] population trend and,
    \item[-] species diversity.
    \end{itemize}
\item Integrate these metrics for different populations.
\item Model observation error.
\end{itemize}


## State-space models

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic models describe how processes change.
    \item Account for observation error.
\end{itemize}

Include the typical HMM schematic plot describing state-space models??

Go on to say that the process we are interested on can take on different forms
such as population abundance or occupancy...

## State-space models (simpler syntax but same result)

- Dynamic models describe how processes change.
- Account for observation error.

## Observation error: abundance example

## Observation error: abundance example (more versatile syntax)

```{r observationerror, out.width="50%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=F, fig.cap = "Some figure legend, if needed..."}
knitr::include_graphics("abund_obs.png")
```

## The SSM

Are you still using Yahkat's model? She has a nice diagram that we could use to explain it. I think it would be good to explain how we can estimate summer and winter trends separately.

## some results

I think we should show some results slides here. Do you have some results ready? Otherwise, we can also show some of the figures from Yahkat or Birgit's papers.

## Observation error: occupancy example

\begin{center}

\end{center}

## Occupancy models

I've got a few slides that I normally use to explain the basics about occupancy models; I've used them in a few toolbox seminars and some of the graphs in the 'template' file were from that.

## Indices, etc.
