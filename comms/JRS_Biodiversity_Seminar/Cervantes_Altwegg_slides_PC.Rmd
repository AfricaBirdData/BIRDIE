```

## Data pipeline


```{r, out.width="70%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("birdie_str.png")
```


## The types of decisions that need to be supported


- Site reports and management plans.

- Provincial State of Biodiversity Report.

- National State of Environment Report.

- Red List and National Biodiversity Assessments.

- Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds.

- ...

## Objectives

- Estimate metrics such as:

    - distribution,
    - abundance,
    - population trend,
    - species diversity.
    
- Integrate these metrics for different populations.

- Model observation error.


## State-space models

  - Dynamic models describe how processes change over time.
  
  - Account for observation error.

## Observation error: abundance example


```{r observationerror, out.width="50%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("abund_obs.png")
```

## A state-space model for CWAC

\begin{columns}[]
  \column{0.55\textwidth}{
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Two counts per year: summer and winter.
      \item + additional counts.
      \item Sites must be well defined in terms of spatial limits.
      \item Standardized counts in terms of: number of observers,
      routes, time of day, viewing techniques, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    
  }

## A state-space model for CWAC


```{r, out.width="70%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=F, fig.cap = "Barshep et al. 2017. Global Ecology and Conservation, 12"}

## Observation error: occupancy example

```{r, out.width="50%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=F, fig.cap = "Some figure legend, if needed..."}
knitr::include_graphics("occu_obs.png")
```


## Occupancy models

I've got a few slides that I normally use to explain the basics about occupancy models; I've used them in a few toolbox seminars and some of the graphs in the 'template' file were from that.

## Indices, etc.
