# Objectives

Provide indicators that help:

- National and international reporting

- Site managers

- Researchers

- Birders

- Local conservation authorities

- â€¦


---

# Challenges

Users with different objectives:

- Different ecological levels of organization

- Different spatial and temporal scales

- Different contexts

- Use a reduced but comprehensive set of indicators **(jamboard!)**

# Data inputs

- **Coordinated Waterbird Counts**

  - Count data
  - Species abundance

- **Southern African Bird Atlas Project**
  - Detection/non-detection data
  - Species distribution

- **Ancillary data**
  - Environmental data


---

# Indicators

- Abundance

- Distribution

- Diversity

- Ancillary

# Indicators

- Define a set of indicators to

  be used broadly

- Build indicators "granularly" and

  scale them up by aggregation

- Make fine-grain components available

- Let the user decide how to use them

---

# How do we aggregate?

Defining groups by carefully classifying:

- species

- sites

**(jamboard!)**
