With increasing pressure on \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Earth }\DIFaddend ecosystems, we have seen \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{substantial }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{important }\DIFaddend efforts in the collection and management of ecological data, over the last decade. This is especially true for freshwater ecosystems, which are among the most impacted by human activity and yet they have been lagging behind in terms of data availability, compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Despite improvements in data collection and accessibility, raw data still need to be analysed and interrogated to support conservation programmes and management decisions, a process that can be complex and time consuming. The South African Biodiversity Data Pipeline for Wetlands and Waterbirds (BIRDIE) aims to help fast and efficient information uptake, bridging the gap between raw ecological datasets and final users. BIRDIE is a full data pipeline that takes up raw data, and through a series of processing steps, estimates indicators related to abundance, distribution and diversity of waterbirds, keeping track of their associated uncertainty. It focuses on the assessment of waterbird populations in South Africa and uses two citizen-science bird monitoring datasets, namely: the African Bird Atlas Project and the Coordinated Waterbird Counts. In addition, a suite of environmental layers help contextualise waterbird population indicators, and link these to the ecological condition of the supporting wetlands. Data processing is conveniently organised in modules that can be run independently, and include tasks, such as: occupancy modelling, state-space modelling, and computation of indicators at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Both data and indicators are accessible to end users through an online portal and through web services. Envisioned users of BIRDIE include government officials, conservation managers, researchers and the general public. Acknowledging that conservation programmes run at multiple scales, from site management to international agreements, we have developed a granular framework in which waterbird population indicators are estimated at small scales, and then these are aggregated to compute similar indicators at broader scales. The online portal is designed to provide spatial and temporal visualisation of the indicators using maps and time series, to help contextualization. This paper describes the structure of the BIRDIE pipeline and the technical features underpinning its components.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Freshwater ecosystems are among the most productive, biodiverse, and
most efficient at capturing and storing carbon (Convention on Wetlands,
2021). Unfortunately, they are also among the most impacted by human
activity (Convention on Wetlands, 2021; Skowno et al., 2019), and
climate change will likely increasingly exacerbate the pressure on
freshwater resources. This is particularly true for the African
continent, home to some of the largest wetlands, which not only host a
wealth of freshwater species, but are also key in supporting human
communities (Stephenson et al., 2020). Such critical issues have fuelled
unprecedented efforts to collect and mobilise freshwater biodiversity
data (Dallas et al., 2021; Wetzel et al., 2015). While we must strive to
keep monitoring programmes that deliver data funded and alive, it is
clear that data on their own are not enough (MacFadyen et al., 2022). If
we are to take effective action to stop ecosystem degradation, it is
important that data are analysed to extract indicators that are
meaningful for decision- and policy-making (Jetz et al., 2019; P.
Stephenson et al., 2017).

Bridging the gap between biodiversity data sets and conservation action
requires, not only collecting, but also analysing and interpreting the
data (Pollock et al., 2020). Furthermore, with continuous data
collection, we need to implement workflows that update indicators and
support decisions in a timely fashion (MacFadyen et al., 2022; Yenni et
al., 2019). Automated data pipelines allow us to keep datasets updated
and free of errors (Yenni et al., 2019), make model-based forecasts, and
evaluate previous forecasts in light of new data (White et al., 2019).
These modern and automated data workflows require multidisciplinary
skills in ecology, statistics, data science, and software development,
but their end products should ideally be free, accessible and easy to
interpret (P. Stephenson et al., 2017). It would also be desirable that
they integrate multiple datasets and environmental layers to produce a
holistic understanding of biodiversity structure and function (MacFadyen
et al., 2022).

South Africa is leading the African continent in terms of biodiversity
data availability (Barnard et al., 2017), with successful
citizen-science programmes such as the Southern African Bird Atlas
Project (Brooks et al., 2022), and biodiversity data platforms, such as
the Biodiversity Advisor (SANBI, 2023) or the Freshwater Biodiversity
Information System (FBIS, Dallas et al., 2021). In contrast, dashboards
and tools that facilitate the timely uptake of information and unlock
the utility of current data are still limited. Here, we describe a data
pipeline that implements a workflow of wetland- and waterbird-related
biodiversity data, the South African Biodiversity Data Pipeline for
Wetlands and Waterbirds (BIRDIE). At its core, BIRDIE utilises two
long-term citizen-science programmes that have collected waterbird data
in South Africa for more than two decades, and are still active: the
Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP; Brooks et al., 2022) and the
Coordinated Waterbird Counts (CWAC; FIAO, 2022). These datasets have
well defined protocols supported by an established community of citizen
scientists, and they provide information about: 1) bird species
occurrence, with visits to a grid of pentads (5' x 5' grid cells) across
Southern Africa (SABAP), and 2) bird abundance, with waterbird counts
taken twice a year at ca. 730 sites across South Africa (CWAC). These
data provide the necessary information to investigate changes in species
abundance and distribution, which are considered the minimum set of
variables necessary to study changes in species populations (Pereira et
al.~2013, Jetz et al.~2020). Apart from waterbird data, BIRDIE uses and
serves ancillary environmental data for contextualising the
aforementioned variables associated with waterbird populations, and also
for describing the state of the wetlands that support them.

The BIRDIE data pipeline was designed to run periodically (yearly in
principle), and automatically (but supervised), to keep information
updated. It is meant to inform the general public about the state of
wetlands and waterbird populations, but also to support the work of
particular end users. A first group of users includes authorities that
need to report on the state of wetlands (e.g., Ramsar Convention), or
migratory waterbirds (e.g.~African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird
Agreement) as required by international agreements, for national level
processes (e.g., National Biodiversity Assessment) and for provincial or
municipal level regulation (e.g.~to set hunting quotas for waterfowl). A
second group of users includes site managers and other stakeholders who
need to make a range of decisions specific to certain wetlands (e.g.,
related to wetland condition and extent) and the waterbirds supported by
these habitats. Such policy-linked outputs are used to inform
environmental strategies, identify priorities for protection and for
sustainable use of biodiversity, and guide land-use management.

\hypertarget{framework-and-target-users}{%
\section*{Framework and target users}\label{framework-and-target-users}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Framework and target users}

Indicators on the state of biodiversity have been adopted by a range of
multilateral environmental agreements including the United Nations
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 2022) and Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs; UN, 2022). New indicators are under development
and established processes, such as the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2022) species red-listing efforts, are
receiving renewed attention (Han et al., 2017). With these indicators
come various global and national initiatives and targets for reducing
rates of biodiversity loss (Mace et al., 2018). Essential Biodiversity
Variables (EBVs) have been conceptualised and developed to help
standardise and improve interoperability of biodiversity data for
monitoring (Pereira et al., 2013).

Within this framework, BIRDIE gives support to both national and
international programs contributing information about the state of
waterbird populations in South Africa, with a view to expand to the
Southern Africa region. We focus primarily on species population EBVs,
with the assessment of waterbird abundance, distribution and diversity,
and changes of these over time (Jetz et al., 2019; Kissling et al.,
2018). Species diversity falls under the community composition EBVs
rather than species populations.

At the international scale, South Africa is signatory to the Ramsar
Convention (Convention on Wetlands, 2021), hosts 28 Wetlands of
International Importance, and needs to produce reports on the state of
sites every three years. Change in condition and extent of wetland
habitat, as well as those Ramsar Criteria invoked when listing the
different sites as internationally important are all core reporting
requirements. These include changes in overall abundance and
distribution of waterbirds at these sites, with special attention to
threatened and migratory species.

National reports must also be compiled for the Agreement on the
Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA; UNEP,
2022), another international agreement, framed under the Convention on
Migratory Species, and focused on protecting migratory waterbirds and
their habitats. Reporting for this agreement requires the full suite of
EBVs outlined earlier in this section, now specific to migratory
species, namely, abundance, distribution, diversity, and changes in
these over time. Within South Africa, there is alignment and cooperation
between Ramsar and AEWA, and as such, reporting on the change in wetland
extent and condition is also relevant.

At the national level, South Africa produces a National Biodiversity
Assessment every four years, which constitutes the main reporting tool
of the state of biodiversity in the country, and informs policy and
conservation strategies (Skowno et al., 2019). At the same time, there
are regular efforts to address the conservation status of South African
species within the IUCN Red-List framework. Changes in abundance and
distribution of species are key in these assessments to track and report
on population trends, and shifts in species ranges and community
diversity.

Keeping these main reporting channels in mind, BIRDIE also intends to
support local management actions and basic research. Site-scale wetland
monitoring is severely limited in South Africa, lagging far behind
monitoring of other aquatic ecosystems such as rivers and estuaries.
Managers ideally need to report on the state of the wetland (e.g.,
wetland condition, flux in surface water extent) as well as the species
that the wetland supports, including species of special concern. Local
waterbird and wetland information can facilitate the development of
site-specific management actions and management plans, and support
permitting decisions. At the same time, linking the local manager inputs
and feedback into the data pipeline closes the gap between large-scale
assessments and local data collection. The data pipeline also allows
citizen scientists to more actively interact with the data they have
collected, and to see it taken up into the statistical analyses and data
visualisations.

\hypertarget{input-data}{%
\section*{Input data}\label{input-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Input data}

South Africa needs to monitor its biodiversity to inform decisions that
affect the environment, and to fulfil reporting obligations linked to
international conventions. Fortunately, we have a number of long-running
citizen science projects that help monitor waterbird populations
throughout the country. At its core, the project leverages two
bird-related datasets: the Coordinated Waterbird Counts (CWAC) and the
South African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2), which is part of the larger
African Bird Atlas Project (ABAP). These datasets have well established
citizen scientist support and offer information about: 1) bird
abundance, with waterbird counts taken twice a year at 731 water bodies
across Southern Africa (mostly South Africa) since 1992, and 2) species
occurrence, with visits to a grid of pentads (5' x 5' grid cells)
initiated in 2007 and covering several African countries.

The Coordinated Waterbird Counts project provides regular counts of all
waterbirds at just over 700 sites throughout South Africa. The project
was launched in 1992 and since then, it has accumulated a long time
series for many sites. However, not all sites have been monitored since
the start of the project, some regions are better represented than
others, and not all sites have been monitored continuously (Figure 3).
Waterbird species have diverse habitat requirements and life histories;
some use the same sites year-round, whereas others are migratory. To
capture this diversity, CWAC counts are carried out twice per year: one
in mid-summer and one in mid-winter. These data are noisy because it is
difficult to count waterbirds precisely, but with appropriate
statistical analyses, they can reveal long-term temporal trends and
seasonal fluctuations in waterbird populations. Waterbird population
sizes and trends are important reporting parameters for international
agreements such as the Ramsar Convention, or AEWA.

ABAP offers occurrence, rather than abundance data. In ABAP, volunteers
collect checklists of all birds observed over a grid of pentads (5' x 5'
minute grid) covering different African countries. We are currently
restricting our analysis to South Africa, and therefore we are using the
SABAP2 component of ABAP (Figure 4). However, in the future we would
like to expand our functionality to cover other countries contributing
data to ABAP, such as Kenya or Nigeria. Under the SABAP2 protocol, which
started in 2007, observers need to spend at least two hours of intensive
birding at a pentad and are asked to visit as many habitats within it as
possible. They can add new species for up to five days. SABAP2 currently
has ca. 17 million records, and \textgreater{} 2 million records are
added per year. The structured sampling protocol, together with the
spatial and temporal extent of SABAP2 allow us to examine how bird
distributions are changing over time, although statistical modelling is
required to account for imperfect detection and sampling biases (Figure
4).

There are a variety of other data sources that BIRDIE uses for adding
environmental information into its analytical workflows. Most of these
data sources are conveniently accessed through Google Earth Engine, such
as TerraClimate (Abatzoglou et al., 2018), the JRC surface water dataset
(Pekel et al., 2016), MODIS Vegetation Indices (Didan, Kamel, 2015) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEM, (Yamazaki et al., 2017). Other data not
yet available on Google Earth Engine, such as the National Wetland Map
(SANBI, in prep.) are managed independently.

\section*{Indicators and statistical
methods}\label{indicators-and-statistical-methods}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Indicators and statistical methods}

Capturing good quality raw data is a fundamental first step to monitor
the state of biodiversity. However, capturing error-free comprehensive
datasets over large temporal and spatial scales requires huge efforts
that are unrealistic in most situations. In fact, the very nature of
natural systems often prevents them from being observed perfectly and
entirely. Therefore, some level of statistical analysis is required to
estimate the state of the system of interest, and separate it from
observational artefacts introduced by the observation process used for
capturing the data (Gimenez et al., 2014; King, 2014; Yoccoz et al.,
2001). The BIRDIE pipeline broadly uses two types of models: i)
occupancy models (Altwegg and Nichols, 2019; MacKenzie et al., 2002) to
estimate the probability of species being present at the different
SABAP2 pentads, and ii) state-space models (Buckland et al., 2004;
Newman et al., 2014) to estimate the number of individuals at the sites
monitored by the CWAC programme. Contrary to raw observations (counts
and detection/non-detection of a species), model-based estimates
(abundance and occupancy probabilities) allow us to quantify
uncertainty.

The variety of end-user needs requires a pipeline that provides
waterbird population indicators at multiple spatial and temporal scales.
Therefore, in addition to estimating basic occupancy and abundance at
small scales (i.e., individual site/pentad), the BIRDIE pipeline
produces other high-level indicators obtained by aggregation (Table 1).
The idea is to follow a process whereby raw data are used to inform
models that estimate indicators at the smallest temporal and spatial
scales possible, and then to aggregate these estimates at larger scales,
as required. For example, species abundance can be estimated for a set
of regularly monitored wetlands in South Africa, and these site-specific
estimates can then be combined to calculate an abundance index for all
sites as a group. We can follow this procedure to estimate abundance and
occupancy probabilities at national, regional and local levels, as well
as for specific groups of wetlands (e.g., designated Ramsar sites,
estuaries or artificial sites (e.g., dams).

The main indicators computed by the BIRDIE pipeline for waterbird
species are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Population size: estimated for CWAC sites in two seasons per year. For
  each species, only those wetlands with at least a ten-year coverage
  between 1997 and 2021 are analysed.
\item
  Occurrence: estimated for ABAP pentads on an annual basis.
\item
  Diversity: the simplest and most easily understood metric is species
  richness. Species richness can be calculated based on the occupancy
  analysis, by summing occupancy probabilities of all species
  potentially present in each pentad, to estimate the expected number of
  species present.
\item
  Important records: sightings of rarities, invasive species. Although
  this information does not require any statistical processing, it does
  make particular records more visible.
\end{itemize}

In addition to estimates of static indicators, the pipeline also
estimates their associated dynamics, such as: changes in abundance,
occupancy probabilities and diversity. The temporal reference for these
dynamics can also vary ranging from a single season to multiple years
(typically ca. 5 years, for short-term changes, and ca. 15 years for
long-term changes). It is important that uncertainty is correctly
propagated when aggregating,, and also when estimating dynamic
indicators. We work in a Bayesian framework and use the posterior
distribution of occupancy probabilities and species abundance to define
indicators at the various scales. Working with full posterior
distributions allows us to conveniently keep track of the uncertainty in
the estimates used as building blocks for other derived indicators.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Delineating species distributions}

Occupancy models are fitted to detection/non-detection data from SABAP2
to delineate the distribution of waterbird species and its dynamics over
time. Within the SABAP2 framework, observers visit pentads and make a
list of the bird species detected during the visit. We assume that
observers identify species correctly and only list species observed (the
rigorous vetting process of SABAP2 data justifies this assumption), but
non-detections may be caused by either species not being present in the
pentad or by observers not being able to detect them, when present.
Therefore, occupancy models describe two processes simultaneously: i)
the underlying occupancy of the sites (pentads), and ii) the observation
process whereby species present might or might not be observed.

More precisely, we define \(z_{jt}\) to be the true occupancy of site
\(j\) in year \(t\), which can be 1 (if species present) or 0 (if
species absent) and has distribution:

\[z_{jt}|\psi_{jt} \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\psi_{jt})\]

where \(\psi_{jt}\) is the occupancy probability at site \(j\) and year
\(t\). The logit transformation of \(\psi_{jt}\) can be modelled as a
linear combination of covariates and smooth functions of covariates,
such that:

\[\textrm{logit}(\psi_{jt}) = \boldsymbol{x}_{jt}^\intercal \boldsymbol{\beta} + \sum_{k=1}^K f_k(u_{jk})\]

where \(u_{jk}\) is a smooth function of the covariate \(u_k\), which is
defined as

\[f_k(u_{jk}) = \sum_{l=1}^L \textrm{B}_l(u_{jkl})\gamma_{jkl}\]

where the smooth function \(f\) is represented by a set of \(L\) basis
functions \(\textrm{B}_l\) evaluated at the value of the covariates
associated with site \(j\) at year \(t\).

Then, the probability of detection of a species that is present in site
\(j\) on visit \(i\) is denoted by \(p_{ij}\). Following the same logic
as for the probability of occupancy, the logit transformation of \(p\)
is modelled as a linear combination of covariates and smooth functions:

\[\textrm{logit}(p_{ij})= \boldsymbol{w}_{ij}^\intercal \boldsymbol{\alpha} + \sum_{h=1}^H f_h(v_{ih})\],

Finally, the likelihood of observation \(y_{ij}\) can be written as:

\[y_{ij}|z_{jt},p_{ij} \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(z_{jt}p_{ij})\]

Spatial, spatio-temporal, and unstructured random effects can be
specified for either occupancy or detection probabilities to account for
variation across sites, observers and visits, not accounted for by the
covariates incorporated in the models.

Each checklist is treated as an independent survey, but occupancy is
assessed on a yearly basis. This means that if a species is detected in
any one survey it is considered present that year. Therefore, missing a
species because it left the site is considered part of the observation
process and not the occupancy process. Migratory birds, for example, are
considered present at a site even if they are only there for part of the
year.

We are fitting single-season occupancy models without spatial random
effects to most species. However, all models incorporate random effects
to account for pentad- and observer-specific detection probabilities. If
model diagnostics indicate poor model fit (see model diagnostics section
below), we try incorporating spatial random effects for occupancy
probabilities with an exponential decay function. Currently, we fit the
models in R (R Core Team, 2022), in a Bayesian framework using the
package spOccupancy (Doser et al., 2022), and running three MCMC chains
for 20,000 iterations, with a thinning interval of 20. We use
non-informative priors for all parameters when no information from other
years is available, but we incorporate information obtained from other
model fits if available, by centering the priors on the closest model's
posterior means. However, it is important noticing that modelling
details may differ among species and may be updated in the future.

\subsection*{Estimating abundance and population
trends}\label{estimating-abundance-and-population-trends}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Estimating abundance and population
trends}

State-space models (Buckland et al., 2004; Newman et al., 2014) are used
to describe and understand dynamic systems that may not be perfectly
observed . Within this framework, we consider waterbird abundance to be
a process that evolves over time, and which we observe during visits to
CWAC sites. However, counts conducted by observers are distorted by
imperfect detection that translates into counting errors. By counting
repeatedly over time, and assuming that abundance evolves smoothly over
time compared to observation error, we can disentangle these two
processes.

We consider that the observed counts (\(y_i\)) at sampling occasion
\(i\) (generally there were two sampling occasions per year, one in
mid-summer and one in mid-winter), at any given site, arise from a
Poisson(\(\lambda_i\)) distribution

\[y_i \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i)\]

And we model the log of the intensity \(\lambda_i\) as:

\[\log{(\lambda_i)} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\]

where \(\mu_i\)is the mean abundance of waterbirds present at a site on
sampling occasion \(i\) and \(\sigma^2\) is the corresponding variance
of the observers counting error, both in the log scale. Therefore,
counts depend both on the number of waterbirds present on site, and on
errors in the counts of these birds.

To model changes in waterbird abundance between the two-seasons of year
\(t\), we define \(s_t\) to be the summer abundance and \(w_t\) the
winter abundance. Note that there might be multiple counts in a single
year and season, but the underlying true abundance is considered to stay
constant in any given year and season (for clarity, note also that while
sampling occasions were indexed by \(i\), years are indexed by \(t\)).
Thus, the expected (log) abundance for any given count can be written as

\[\mu_{i} = s_t \textrm{summer} + w_t \textrm{winter}\]

where `summer' is an indicator variable that takes on the value 1 in
summer and 0 in winter, and `winter' is the opposite. We then define
abundance dynamics as:

\[s_t = s_{t-1} + \beta_t\] \[w_t = s_t + \xi_t\]

where \(\beta_t\) corresponds to the change in summer abundance from
year \(t-1\) to year \(t\), and \(\xi_t\) is the difference between
summer and winter abundance, both in the log scale. If exponentiated,
these parameters can be interpreted as the rate of change in the
population and the winter-to-summer ratio of the population,
respectively.

We impose relatively smooth changes in abundance by defining
autocorrelation in and terms over time. In addition, we define
relationships between the rate of change in the population and
environmental covariates. These relationships facilitate the estimation
of abundance for those years in which counts are missing, and it is
particularly useful to contain uncertainty in long periods with missing
data between counts. Thus, we set

We impose relatively smooth changes in abundance by defining
autocorrelation in \(\beta_t\) and \(\xi_t\) terms over time. In
addition, we define relationships between the rate of change in the
population \(\beta_t\) and environmental covariates. These relationships
facilitate the estimation of abundance for those years in which counts
are missing, and it is particularly useful to contain uncertainty in
long periods with missing data between counts. Thus, we set

\[\beta_{t} = \phi\beta_{t-1} + \eta_{t-1} + \zeta_{t-1}\]
\[\xi_{t} = \xi_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t-1}\]

where \(\phi\) lies between zero and one, and it defines an
autoregressive term on \(\beta_{t-1}\); \(\eta_t\) captures the effect
of covariates in the expected change in abundance, and can be expanded
to \(\gamma^{\intercal}\mathrm{U}\), where \(\mathrm{U}\) is a matrix of
covariate values and \(\gamma\) a vector of coefficients; \(\zeta_t\)
and \(\epsilon_t\) are random variables that represent change in
abundance change, and change in winter to summer ratio, respectively.

We mentioned at the beginning that this model applies to each monitored
site. However, we have multiple sites, and counts are often missing for
some seasons or even full years. To facilitate the estimation of
abundance with missing data, we borrow information from sites with
counts, by defining a hierarchical structure such that:

\[\zeta_{tj} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\zeta t})\]
\[\epsilon_{tj} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon t})\]

so that random changes at any site and year come from a common
distribution of changes across all sites for that year. These
distributions are normal with variances \(\sigma^2_{\zeta t}\) and
\(\sigma^2_{\epsilon t}\) for changes in abundance and winter to summer
ratio, respectively.

We fit these models in R (R Core Team, 2022) with the additional
functionality provided by JAGS (Plummer, 2003) using the package jagsUI
(Kellner, 2021). We work on a Bayesian framework, using non-informative
priors, and running three chains for 10,000 iterations each. Similar to
the occupancy models, these are the details of the models we are working
with at the moment, and they are intended to give an idea of the type of
model we are using. These models might be updated in the future and the
updated modelling details will be published on the BIRDIE website.

\subsection*{Data and model
diagnostics}\label{data-and-model-diagnostics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data and model diagnostics}

The pipeline needs to run for a multitude of species, with different
ecological requirements and geographical distributions. Therefore,
finding a model that suits all species is challenging. Not only may a
model not be a good fit for a particular species, but the algorithms
used for fitting the model may fail to converge due to characteristics
of the data.

In a first control stage, we have defined some minimum requirements data
should meet to enter the model-fitting process. Species that have been
observed in five or less pentads in a year are considered to not have
enough data to inform an occupancy model. Similarly, we chose only those
CWAC sites that have been counted at least ten times between 1993 and
2021, to fit state-space models. Otherwise, data tend to be too sparse
to assess trends in abundance reliably. These thresholds are rather
arbitrary, based on our own preliminary experiences, and they are
considered to be the minimum requirements for models to converge
successfully. However, meeting these requirements does not guarantee
model convergence or a good fit. To keep track of potential issues
arising during model fitting, and to improve the algorithms of the
pipeline, each time the pipeline runs it generates several reports that
are later examined.

To decide whether any occupancy or state-space model converges, we
calculate the Gelman-Rubin (Rhat) diagnostic (Gelman et al., 2014) for
each estimated parameter. These diagnostics are then tabulated and
stored for future revision. Any Rhat value above 1.1 or below 0.9 is
considered to represent lack of convergence. Distinctive characteristics
of the models with convergence issues are explored and addressed on a
case by case basis, after the pipeline has finished running.

In addition to convergence, we assess goodness of fit using posterior
predictive checks (Doser et al., 2022; Gelman et al., 2014). This
procedure compares some quantity of interest calculated using
pseudo-data simulated from the model posterior distribution, with that
same quantity calculated from the observed data. In a well-fitting model
we would expect real and synthetic data to produce similar values. For
occupancy models, we produce simulated detection/non-detection data for
each site, species and year and compute the expected number of
detections out of as many visits as there were in the data. We compare
the results of the simulations with the observed number of detections
recorded in the data using a Chi-square test. For state-space models we
follow a similar procedure, but instead of simulating
detection/non-detection data for one year, we simulate count data for
summer and winter, and aggregate these in a single annual count. Results
from the goodness of fit Chi-square tests are also tabulated and stored
for revision. Significant deviations detected with these tests are
addressed for each case individually.

Due to the computational burden of the pipeline, it is not possible to
run multiple models for each species, site and year, to perform model
selection. Therefore, model selection is performed on a sample of
species, selected to have representation of common and scarce taxa, but
that are otherwise selected arbitrarily. Our general approach has been
to include a rich set of variables that we believe can explain the main
environmental gradients within our geographical range, without paying
too much attention to multi-collinearity and overfitting. We are
therefore cautious about making causal inference or predictions out of
the range of the data, and so should be other users.

\hypertarget{systems-and-technology}{%
\section*{Systems and technology}\label{systems-and-technology}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Systems and technology}

This section describes the servers, database and dashboard technology.
We present the process whereby the data is processed along the pipeline
and transformed into indicators that are presented to the final user.
There are multiple formats in which the information is presented to be
able to accommodate the needs of downstream systems. BIRDIE's data, code
and outputs are stored and run on three main systems (Figure 5): the
Africa Bird Data servers, and the two BIRDIE servers (servers A and B).

The Africa Bird Data servers are hosted at the FitzPatrick Institute for
African Ornithology (FIAO), University of Cape Town, and contain the
CWAC and ABAP databases. They also serve these data through an
Application Programming Interface (API).

BIRDIE's server A is the access point of the final user to the
information generated by BIRDIE. This information is stored in a data
mart. At its core, the data mart is a MySQL database (version 8.0.27), a
widely used, open source, relational database management system. Its
main objective is to store BIRDIE's outputs in a way that provides easy
and flexible access to the final user. At the same time, the structure
of the database ensures that the inputs and outputs conform to a given
standard, and creates security back-ups for the stored data. The main
mechanism BIRDIE uses to present data to the user is through OpenAPI web
services (OpenAPI Specification, Version 3.1.0), which was designed to
provide a standard interface for documenting and exposing APIs. The
public web services offered by the OpenAPI give users the flexibility to
access and download data from the database in multiple ways, without
being constrained by specific functionality of a web application. This
technology facilitates the integration of BIRDIE's outputs into other
workflows. For the user that is interested in readily accessing the
information through a dashboard, we have deployed a web application,
written in HTML5, CSS, and the most common and popular JavaScript
libraries, including OpenLayers (\url{https://openlayers.org/}) and
Plotly (\url{https://plotly.com/}). Among other elements (see section
6), the web application features a map viewer, based on mviewer
(\url{https://mviewer.netlify.app/en/}), a free and open-source
cartographic application, that has an easy-to-use and intuitive
interface.

If we thought of server A as being the face of the pipeline, server B
would be the brain. All the functionality in this server revolves around
statistical modelling. This server connects with the Africa Bird Data
servers to obtain CWAC and ABAP data, and with external systems, such as
Google Earth Engine or SANBI servers to obtain environmental
information. It then runs the main analytical modules of the pipeline,
where occupancy and state-space models are fitted. The analytical
workflows are supported by an Intel Xeon Dual 8 core, with 64 GB RAM and
an 8 TB hard drive. The model outputs are made available to server A,
where they are incorporated into the data mart, used to compute derived
high-level indicators by aggregation (see section 4), and prepared to be
presented to the final users.

\hypertarget{web-application}{%
\section*{Web application}\label{web-application}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Web application}

BIRDIE's web application offers four main menus that provide access to
the pipeline outputs in different ways (see Figure 6):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  An exploration map. Through this menu the user is free to explore the
  different indicators BIRDIE computes using a map. This spatial
  framework can be configured to display information layers, such as
  occupancy probabilities for ABAP pentads or waterbird abundance at
  CWAC sites. Users can also zoom in and out to find the scale that best
  fits their needs.
\item
  Site and species summaries, are detailed reports elaborated for users
  specifically interested in sites or species, rather than in general
  exploration. These summaries can also be accessed indirectly through
  the exploration map.
\item
  Reporting tools. We mentioned in section 2 that BIRDIE was developed
  to support reports for national and international conservation
  programmes. In this menu, users interested in elaborating, or
  accessing the information underpinning these reports, will find this
  information conveniently packed in programme-specific summaries.
\item
  Web services. Through this menu users can access BIRDIE's API and
  retrieve its outputs in the most flexible way. It is through BIRDIE's
  API that all maps and plots in the web application are produced. By
  accessing this functionality directly, users can download the data
  themselves and incorporate them into their own workflows.

\section*{Discussion}\label{discussion}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Discussion}

Data on biodiversity and related environmental drivers are collected at
increasingly faster rates. Although these data can be accessed to
support decisions at various levels, it can be difficult for decision
makers to extract relevant information in a timely fashion (MacFadyen et
al., 2022; P. J. Stephenson et al., 2017). Here, we introduce BIRDIE,
the South African Biodiversity Data Pipeline for Wetlands and
Waterbirds; a data pipeline that aims to provide the information needed
for making evidence-based decisions on wetlands and waterbirds in
southern Africa. Target users of BIRDIE include government and public
entities that need to report on the status of wetlands and waterbirds,
as well as site managers, and the general public (e.g., birdwatchers).
Apart from data availability and accessibility, obstacles for using
biodiversity data in decision-making include (MacFadyen et al., 2022; P.
J. Stephenson et al., 2017): lack of analysis and interpretation, lack
of technical accessibility with excessive use of jargon, and timely use
of data.

All data used by BIRDIE are freely available, so one of the core
objectives of BIRDIE is to facilitate information uptake by
statistically analysing these data and filtering out observational
artefacts introduced during data collection. Uneven sampling efforts,
imperfect detection and missing data are all examples of how data
collection methods can affect data, and if undealt with, mislead
decision making. Furthermore, statistical models also provide measures
of uncertainty in their estimates, which must be clearly communicated to
the stakeholders. With all their benefits, these statistical analyses
require technical knowledge and are time-consuming. Therefore, having
their outputs pre-computed and readily available could dramatically
increase the impact of the data.

BIRDIE relies heavily on citizen science projects such as ABAP and CWAC,
which poses clear challenges in terms of uneven efforts and imperfect
detection, but also adds the advantage of having the support of a large
community of observers that provides a continuous and steady flow of
data. These data inputs allow us to run the pipeline periodically to
keep the indicators updated and timely. Although we would like to update
our indicators more often, for now we only update once per year due to
the computational requirements of the pipeline, and certain
characteristics of the data (e.g., CWAC counts are conducted only twice
a year).

Our web application was designed to present indicators that are easily
accessed, visualised and interpreted, avoiding unnecessary jargon. At
the same time, and for the interested user, we have allocated some space
for clearly explaining the analytical routines used in all the analyses
in dedicated sections. In BIRDIE, we try to follow the Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles (Wilkinson et al.,
2016), making all processes reproducible and transparent. All the code
used by the pipeline is public, freely available and based on
open-source software.

Whenever possible we allow the user to display multiple pieces of
information in the same screen, including some environmental data that
we consider relevant, to facilitate information contextualization. For
certain specific users, namely those interested in the main national and
international reporting channels (e.g., Ramsar, AEWA, NBA), we prepare
dedicated reports that combine the information that suits their needs.
The contents of these reports have been defined during stakeholder
engagement, and are intended to be dynamically adapted to new
necessities.

The BIRDIE data pipeline consists of several fundamental building
blocks. The first block, which we call the data source layer (Figure 5)
hosts and curates the raw data. Vetting and data cleaning also happens
in this block. The second block, the analysis layer, analyses the data
and estimates the fundamental quantities of interest, like abundance and
occurrence of each species at each wetland. The third block consists of
a data mart where the outputs of the analysis are stored and indicators
are aggregated or disaggregated to multiple scales. The final block
serves the information to the user via a web application. The modular
structure of BIRDIE enables us to maintain and update individual parts
independently. For example, we could replace the current statistical
routines with more efficient ones without changing the other parts of
the pipeline. Or we could add new indicators to the data mart layer
without needing to change the statistical routines that produce the
underlying components.

Running models automatically and periodically for multiple species
requires pre-defininging models and using similar models for all
species. Therefore there is a trade-off between having accurate models
that fit individual species well and having a pipeline that works well
for all species in general. Users should keep in mind this compromise,
and think of BIRDIE's outputs as useful approximations rather than
precise estimates. We recommend designing bespoke models for those
species for which precision is required.

In the next phase, we intend to develop more profound links between
waterbird population indicators and wetlands. Waterbirds are often
regarded as good indicators of wetland biodiversity and condition.
However, this assumption is rarely proven empirically, and it is
apparent that it needs careful consideration on a case by case basis
(Amat and Green, 2010). With advances in the accessibility to
biodiversity data, we are now in a better position to investigate
whether these claims hold, and if so, under which conditions. Data
portals such as GBIF.org and in South Africa, the Freshwater
Biodiversity Information System (FBIS), and SANBI's biodiversity data
portal. SANBI has also been developing the wetland condition map that
provides information about the ecological status of wetlands, looking at
elements such as water quality and vegetation. These additional sources
of information could help us understand how waterbird occurrence,
abundance and diversity relates to the general ecological condition of
the hosting wetlands.

We will also extend BIRDIE's functionality to cover other African
countries with similar available data, such as Kenya and Nigeria that
also use the ABAP protocol. There is also a wealth of information that
BIRDIE has not yet used, such as eBird or iNaturalist, that could
improve the outputs of the pipeline. However, integrating data sources
with different sampling designs, coverages and biases is not trivial.
Data integration is a very active topic in the field of statistical
ecology. Approaches to combining data range from pooling multiple data
sources together disregarding their different assumptions and biases, to
much more accurate integrated models in which characteristics of each
data source are explicitly accounted for (Fletcher et al., 2019).
Although at the expense of increased model complexity, with the
application of newly-developed statistical methods for data integration,
we can now explore how different species interrelate, and inform more
effective and efficient conservation actions.

\caption{Main indicators produced by the BIRDIE pipeline for waterbird species. For each indicator, we show the inputs, which can be databases (Coordinated Waterbird Counts - CWAC and the African Bird Atlas Project - ABAP), or other indicators; models used to compute the indicator (state-space model -SSM, and occupancy model - Occupancy) or whether it was computed by aggregating other lower-level indicators; the smaller spatial scale of assessment; and the smaller temporal scale of assessment. Annual changes in all of these indicators are also computed, and other indicators will be added over time as needed.}
