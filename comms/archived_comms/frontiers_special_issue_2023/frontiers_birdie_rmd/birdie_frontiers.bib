	abstract = {JAGS is a program for Bayesian Graphical modelling which aims for compatibility with Classic BUGS. The program could eventually be developed as an R package. This article explains the motivations for this program, briefly describes the architecture and then discusses some ideas for a vectorized form of the BUGS language. 1 BUGS BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) is a program for analyzing Bayesian graph-ical models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation [1]. It is aimed at applied statisticians who have a problem that does not fit into a standard model class, but who do not wish to write their own custom software. BUGS fills an important role by making the analysis of problems with various sources of "complexity" such as random effects, measurement error and missing data accessible to a wide audience. The BUGS project has promoted the Bayesian approach not only through the BUGS program, but also through the accompanying documentation, which includes a large collection of worked examples taken from the literature, and practical advice on model construction and criticism. The development team have also used BUGS as a platform for exploring new ideas in Bayesian modelling. Recently they proposed the "Deviance information criterion" [2], a Bayesian analogue of the Akaike Information Criterion, which has been implemented in WinBUGS and will most likely become very popular as a result. More speculative ideas, such as "cuts" in the graph, which allow only a one-way flow of information in the graph, have also been implemented.},

	abstract = {Large-scale citizen-science projects, such as atlases of species distribution, are an important source of data for macroecological research, for understanding the effects of climate change and other drivers on biodiversity, and for more applied conservation tasks, such as early-warning systems for biodiversity loss. However, citizen-science data are challenging to analyse because the observation process has to be taken into account. Typically, the observation process leads to heterogeneous and non-random sampling, false absences, false detections, and spatial correlations in the data. Increasingly, occupancy models are being used to analyse atlas data. We advocate a dual approach to strengthen inference from citizen science data for the questions the programme is intended to address: (a) the survey design should be chosen with a particular set of questions and associated analysis strategy in mind and (b) the statistical methods should be tailored not only to those questions but also to the specific characteristics of the data. We review the consequences of particular survey design choices that typically need to be made in atlas-style citizen-science projects. These include spatial resolution of the sampling units, allocation of effort in space, and collection of information about the observation process. On the analysis side, we review extensions of the basic occupancy models that are frequently necessary with atlas data, including methods for dealing with heterogeneity, non-independent detections, false detections, and violation of the closure assumption. New technologies, such as cell-phone apps and fixed remote detection devices, are revolutionizing citizen-science projects. There is an opportunity to maximize the usefulness of the resulting datasets if the protocols are rooted in robust statistical designs and data analysis issues are being considered. Our review provides guidelines for designing new projects and an overview of the current methods that can be used to analyse data from such projects.},

Effective conservation and management of wetlands biodiversity requires data on species status and threats to inform decision-making. However, there are key challenges in Africa around the availability, usability and quality of data, willingness to use data, and capacity. We review these challenges, using examples from Ramsar sites and other wetlands across the continent, and propose solutions to help information users access high quality data in the right format at the right time. We assess the relevance of traditional monitoring methods, as well as innovative new tools such as remote sensing and environmental DNA. We conclude by explaining how governments, civil society and the private sector can enhance data collection by applying common, policy-relevant indicators, scaling up the application of traditional and appropriate new tools and protocols, building capacity in key institutions, and using partnerships and credible science-policy interfaces. Only by sharing and upscaling the solutions to data collection and use will we be able to mainstream biodiversity into decision-making and ultimately stop biodiversity loss across African wetlands.},

The system process is often a function of the demographic parameters of interest, such as survival probabilities, transition rates between states, and/or abundance, whereas the model parameters associated with the observation process are conditional on the underlying state of the system.

Detecting critical ecosystem changes, such as losing unique biodiversity and ecosystem services, is dependent on access to data. A wealth of biodiversity data exists for river ecosystems in South Africa, but an operational information system to access these data is currently not available. This gap is the result of limited capacity for managing freshwater biodiversity data, with existing systems isolated, difficult to access and not well maintained. To address this knowledge gap, the Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS) has been developed. The FBIS is a powerful, visual, data-rich information system for hosting and serving freshwater biodiversity data. It serves as a platform for the inventory and maintenance of data, thereby facilitating the evaluation of long-term change in river biodiversity and ecosystem condition, and guiding future monitoring strategies and management decisions. System design and functionality was strongly informed by data and reporting needs of key end-user groups, including water resource managers, biodiversity and conservation managers and planners, scientific researchers, and environmental consultants. Future expansion aims to increase the diversity of data accessed, data flow, geographic coverage and strategically embed FBIS into South Africa’s main freshwater decision-making pipelines.},

However, many government agencies cannot access or use the biodiversity data they need to make informed decisions for environmental and economic management. More than forty stakeholders representing governments, civil society organizations (CSOs) and UN agencies, including delegates from 20 African states, identified decisions that require biodiversity information and explored blockages and potential solutions to data access and use. The participants concluded that the key enabling environment includes data availability, data quality and usability, willingness to collect and use data, and financial and technical capacity. We recommend that African government departments across sectors work with academic bodies and CSOs to: i) enhance internal resources for monitoring and develop partnerships with donors; ii) build capacity for data collection, using tools, guidelines and communities surrounding CBD planning and biodiversity monitoring; iii) improve national and international co-ordination and cross-sectoral collaboration for biodiversity data management; iv) produce and use more data-derived products that encourage data use, especially assessments that demonstrate the importance of biodiversity to economies and wellbeing and dashboards that facilitate interpretation and analysis. Governments, CSOs and academic bodies should test different science-policy interfaces in a handful of pilot countries or regions, building on existing models to demonstrate how data providers and users can work together to break down barriers to data access and sharing and mainstream biodiversity information into decision-making.},

This highlights the significance of reliable, integrated information for guiding and assessing actions and policies aimed at managing and sustaining the many functions and benefits of species. Here we synthesize the types of data and approaches that are required to achieve such an integration and conceptualize ‘essential biodiversity variables’ (EBVs) for a unified global capture of species populations in space and time. The inherent heterogeneity and sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We define the species population EBVs as a space–time–species–gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or species data, this fundamental species population information directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem function indicators. The unified concept we present links disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for species population monitoring in which data collection is closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support effective biodiversity assessment.},

	abstract = {Occupancy modelling is a common approach to assess species distribution patterns, while explicitly accounting for false absences in detection–nondetection data. Numerous extensions of the basic single-species occupancy model exist to model multiple species, spatial autocorrelation and to integrate multiple data types. However, development of specialized and computationally efficient software to incorporate such extensions, especially for large datasets, is scarce or absent. We introduce the spOccupancy R package designed to fit single-species and multi-species spatially explicit occupancy models. We fit all models within a Bayesian framework using Pólya-Gamma data augmentation, which results in fast and efficient inference. spOccupancy provides functionality for data integration of multiple single-species detection–nondetection datasets via a joint likelihood framework. The package leverages Nearest Neighbour Gaussian Processes to account for spatial autocorrelation, which enables spatially explicit occupancy modelling for potentially massive datasets (e.g. 1,000s–100,000s of sites). spOccupancy provides user-friendly functions for data simulation, model fitting, model validation (by posterior predictive checks), model comparison (using information criteria and k-fold cross-validation) and out-of-sample prediction. We illustrate the package's functionality via a vignette, simulated data analysis and two bird case studies. The spOccupancy package provides a user-friendly platform to fit a variety of single and multi-species occupancy models, making it straightforward to address detection biases and spatial autocorrelation in species distribution models even for large datasets.},

	abstract = {Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it remains challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing biodiversity status and trends. The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a ‘Big Data’ approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence-only or presence–absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key workﬂow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workﬂow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identiﬁcation and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identiﬁed workﬂow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, ﬁndable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and ﬁlling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workﬂows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modiﬁcation and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals.},

	abstract = {The world is firmly cemented in a notitian age (Latin: notitia, meaning data) – drowning in data, yet thirsty for information and the synthesis of knowledge into understanding. As concerns over biodiversity declines escalate, the volume, diversity and speed at which new environmental and ecological data are generated has increased exponentially. Data availability primes the research and discovery engine driving biodiversity conservation. South Africa (SA) is poised to become a world leader in biodiversity conservation. However, continent-wide resource limitations hamper the establishment of inclusive technologies and robust platforms and tools for biodiversity informatics. In this perspectives piece, we bring together the opinions of 37 co-authors from 20 different departments, across 10 SA universities, 7 national and provincial conservation research agencies, and various institutes and private conservation, research and management bodies, to develop a way forward for biodiversity informatics in SA. We propose the development of a SA Biodiversity Informatics Hub and describe the essential components necessary for its design, implementation and sustainability. We emphasise the importance of developing a culture of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among custodians of biodiversity data to establish operational workflows for data synthesis. However, our biggest challenges are misgivings around data sharing and multidisciplinary collaboration. We recommend a system that is free, user friendly, functional, stable, integrative and designed to cater for different data access agreement levels. Sharing data through this pipeline will directly advance the science and practice of conservation, giving multiple stakeholders and decision-makers access to valuable biodiversity data to support research and biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Developing indicators for monitoring biodiversity, as called for by the Convention on Biological Diversity and 2020 Aichi Targets, is challenging in many countries due to data and capacity gaps. One proposed solution is to disaggregate global datasets to generate national-level indicators for countries where these values do not exist, but to date there are few examples where this approach has been systematically applied and its efﬁcacy investigated. Using comparisons of disaggregated global data and data generated nationally for four indicators in ﬁve tropical Andean countries, we show that the two approaches can often lead to divergent values. Differences between values gathered using these two methods vary according to country and indicator, with the average differences for all countries as 26\% for forest cover loss (maximum Bolivia 31\%), 10\% for the Red List Index (maximum Venezuela 27\% for birds), 14\% for protected area coverage of Key Biodiversity Areas (maximum Colombia 25\%), and 67\% for carbon sequestration potential (maximum Peru 102\%). Most of the variations are due to methodological differences, calling into question the reliability of inter-country comparisons and roll-ups of national indicator data to regional or global scales. Nationally-generated indicators are desirable because they have the greatest power to inﬂuence national policy. However, in cases where regional or global consistency is needed, such as assessments by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and Global Environmental Outlook, assessors should rely on global and regionally-disaggregated global data to elucidate trends and spatial patterns for most indicators. To broaden the utility of nationally-generated indicators, the biodiversity indicators community must agree on methodological standards, ensure that local stakeholders' needs are understood and addressed, develop incentives for the use of these standards, and communicate them to practitioners at all levels.},

	abstract = {It is a hard reality that virtually all countries, no matter how well resourced, take conservation and land use decisions based on highly patchy and imperfect data - if indeed any data at all. Despite a mushrooming of scientiﬁc evidence and journals in the past decade, and open-access provision of many expensive global datasets, developing countries in particular often have to make do with inaccurate and coarse-scale global data, in the absence of targeted, local data to solve immediate conservation problems. To what extent can citizen science data compensate for the patchiness of conventional government-gathered scientiﬁc data in order to support planning, policy and management? We demonstrate how southern Africa's citizen science-based “early warning system for biodiversity” is used to support land-use planning and conservation decisions, including Red List, strategic and project-based environmental impact assessments and national protected area expansion and implementation strategies. This system integrates volunteer-based species atlases such as the Protea Atlas Project and Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP), species population monitoring such as the Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildﬂowers (CREW) project, and site-based rapid assessment and monitoring such as MyBirdPatch and BioBlitz. Countries in southern Africa are on a sharp continuum of research capacity, funding, political engagement and own datasets. Yet there is the capacity for adaptive management systems based in signiﬁcant part on civil society volunteerism. Crucially, these must be underpinned by statistically sound, simple, repeatable scientiﬁc protocols, which are still rare in Africa.},

We propose a model and likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when detection probabilities are Ͻ1. The model provides a ﬂexible framework enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities (Ͼ0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring program, Frogwatch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo americanus), a 44\% increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed, and as 0.85 for spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.},

	abstract = {We develop a uniﬁed framework for jointly deﬁning population dynamics models and measurements taken on a population. The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be speciﬁed. The method is fully ﬂexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator–prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reﬂect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures.},
