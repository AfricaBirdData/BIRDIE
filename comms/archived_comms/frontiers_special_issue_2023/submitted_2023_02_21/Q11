For each indicator, we show: "Input", which can be databases (CWAC, Coordinated Waterbird Counts; ABAP, African Bird Atlas Project), or other indicators; "Model used" to compute the
indicator (SSM, state-space model; Occupancy, occupancy model) or whether it was computed by aggregating other lower-level indicators; the smallest "Spatial scale" of assessment; and the smallest
"Temporal scale" of assessment. Annual changes in all of these indicators are also computed, and other indicators will be added over time as needed. Indicators are: "Abundance", number or individuals; "Diversity", number of species; "Extent of occurrence", area of minimum complex polygon enclosing sites with species presence; "Area of occupancy", area of sites (SABAP2 pentads) with species presence, "Population size", number of individuals in South Africa; "Population proportion on site", percentage of the population present on each site; "Waterbird Conservation Value", index based on Harebottle and Underhill, 2016; "Number of sites", number of CWAC sites where the species is present.
