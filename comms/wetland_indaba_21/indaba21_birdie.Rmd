# Introduction

- Wetlands are heavily impacted by human activities

- They need effective and efficient monitoring

- Data missing for many taxonomic groups

- Birds are often used as indicators for other species

- Even bird data is scattered and needs processing

# What is BIRDIE?

# What is BIRDIE for?

Our objective is to support decision makers:

- International agreements, such as RAMSAR, require:

  - Wetlands with more than 1% of the population of a species
  - Wetlands that host more than 20,000 birds regularly
  
  
- National programmes, such as National Biodiversity Assessments:

  - Species area of occupancy
  - Population rate of change
