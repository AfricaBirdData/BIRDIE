\arguments{
\item{sp_code}{SAFRING code of the species to run the pipeline for}

\item{sp_name}{Common name of the species to run the pipeline for. This is
necessary for plots and summaries.}

\item{year}{Year to run to the pipeline for}

\item{config}{A list with pipeline configuration parameters.

occupancy probabilities in South Africa for a selected species. These
occupancy probabilities form the basis for building more elaborated
indicators in other pipeline branches.
